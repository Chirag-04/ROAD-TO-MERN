1. Syncrhonous nature means doing things sequentially  , one after other 
While ASyncrhonous means parallelizing the things , context switching between task 
It is same as Preempt and Not Preempt CPU scheduling algorithm in OS 
Real world example of async function is reading files from the file system 
Advantage of async function is that net amount of time taken to do a task can be decreased 
Example fetch  , readfile in node js , setTimeout
